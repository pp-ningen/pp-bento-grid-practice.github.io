## My process



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

```html
<h1>What I learned in HTML</h1>
<p>I was already familiar with what I used in terms of creating the divs, spans, and linking the css styles sheet to the main page. <b>However,</b> I did learn about creating variables in CSS. It made it easier to spread the color palette and styles between classes.</p>
```
```css
:root {
    --primary-subdued: hsl(254, 88%, 90%);
    --primary-base: hsl(256, 67%, 59%);
    --accent-subdued: hsl(31, 66%, 93%);
    --accent-base: hsl(39, 100%, 71%);
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --off-white: hsl(0, 0%, 96%);
    --black: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);

    --fs-reg: 1.5rem;

    --fs-md: 2.25rem;
    --fs-lg: 3rem;
    --fs-xl: 4rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on stylizing a webpage to fit multiple devices. I also want to utilize grids more, for example, creating a gallery page on a project and being able to enhance this bento grid by making each grid dynamic or interactable while being focused on.

## Acknowledgments

Kevin Powell on YouTUbe definitely helped a lot. I would not have known about using variables in CSS otherwise.
